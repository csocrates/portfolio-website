                Iâ€™m beginning my journey into this realm of code as I want to be a part of the next revolution, the next stage of our evolution, onto the virtualscape where 1s and 0s are translated into hopes and desires, transmuted into great fortunes, spent on virtual land and one-of-a-kind works of art. <br>
                <br>
                I want to be an architect in this world, which is a series of worlds, interconnected in ways we are yet to understand.<br>
                <br>
                I want to add to the world something good, something that removes power from the powerful that misuse it. 
                <br>
                <br> I believe that tech can lift us out of once great, but now defunct systems. <br>
                <br>
                I believe in blockchain and yes, <br>
                <br>I like reading sci-fi.</p>
